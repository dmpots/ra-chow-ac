This is the code I wrote for my [master's thesis](http://davidpeixotto.com/publications/2008-05-10-masters-thesis.html) on [priority-based register allocation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/88616.88621).

This piece of code implements the hill-climbing search for good parameters for the register allocator. It buids on the [adaptive compilation](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1088083) ideas from other researchers at Rice.

It is mostly useful only for historical interest (mainly to me).
