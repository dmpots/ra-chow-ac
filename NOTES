Notes on adaptive compilation with Tim

=============================================
1) think of each search as happening independently. no need to tie the
params together.

2) greedy search - take the first downward step that you find. don't
wait to generate all of your neighbors, instead just explore as
needed and when you find one that is better then take it immeaditly.
Note that this means you will have to keep track of which neighbors
have already been explored and not explore those again.

3) patience - tells you when to stop the search. specify the number of
neighbors to look at before restarting

4) implementation - use worklists for each file. each search is
happening independently. when you find a local minima for one then you
can restart that search independently of the other functions


write down what you first tried and how it came up short:
The first iteration we tried to make the state space be a set of file
and args for that file. The problem is that when you have the database
at hand you may find that you have already generated some neighbors of
a point. There is no need to compile those again and you can just
lookup the value in the database. Howerver this means that you are not
really exploring on that iteration of the search for that file. In
essence the slowest to progress is holding you back. If all of the
neighbors for a file have been seen then you would like to pick the
best and explore some more from that location. Otherwise you can not
compile that file in this round of searching, but you will lose out on
making any progress in that file. by searching on the files
independently this also means that you can restart the search for any
files that reach a local minimum. Thus different files can be in
different parts of the search. You need to keep track of the best that
you found so far so that when the search ends you have the best value.

We are describing a method for 2-d adaptive compiler search.

Neighbor structure:
Each neighbor is found by taking one parameter and switching its
value. This means that there are 418 total neighbors for a given
state. Each state is a setting of each of the params. Since there are
418 different settings total, there are 418 different neighbors. Only
one setting is changed at a time, otherwise there would be a
combinatorial explosion and the number of neighbors would be too great.

b - 11
l - 406 (29 * 14)
e - 2
m - 2
z - 2
t - 2
c - 4
s - 2
g - 2
o - 2
a - 2
------
437 total

Gives 426 neighbors since one value is excluded for each argument.
